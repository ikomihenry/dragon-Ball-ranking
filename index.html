<h4> his story is a little bit long hope you enjoy.</h4>
 <p>
This story is slightly summarized as I didn’t go into full detail about all his experiences and personal life. It took me a while to write this so please don’t hate! Enjoy!

Obito Uchiha the most misunderstood, and my personal favourite naruto character. Obito was an orphan born into the 
uchiha clan and unlike his fellow clansmen was never a prodigy of any sort. From a young age he met Rin Nohara and Ka
kashi Hatake(the former having a crush on and the latter forming a rivalry against). From a very young age Obito had t
he dream and ambition of becoming hokage. At the age of 5 Obito enlisted in the academy, only to show up late on orien
ation. He was put on a four man team alongside Rin and Kakashi with Minato Namikaze as their sensei. After a few missi
ons they took part in the chunin exams in which they failed. Only Kakashi was promoted to chunin rank and he grew extr
emely jealous of him. After training his all he finally was promoted to chunin only to find out that Kakashi was bein
g premoted to a jonin rank. During the 3rd shinobi world war Rin and Obito alongside Kakashi (who was their captain) 
ire on a mission to destroy Kannabi Bridge during the mission the young Konoha Shino are ambushed by shinobi from Iw
agakure Rin gets captured and Kakashi, as him being the captain, orders Obito that they continue the mission. Obito ge
ts mad and punches Kakashi and goes off to save Rin. As Obito is getting defeated by the enemy Kakashi has a change o
f heart and comes to save Obito during which Kakashi is injured in his left eye. Obito, then overtaken by a strong de
sire to protect his comrades awakens his Sharingan and kills the first of their two enemies. Kakashi is patched up an
 the two head off to face the second of the two men, which they defeat and think they’ve killed. They rescue Rin but it
 urns out the second man was still alive he causes the cave they are in to collapse as they are running towards the e
 xit Kakashi gets hit on the head with a rock which causes him to lose consciousness, Obito then throws Kakashi t
 o safety and takes his places as a massive boulder crushes the right side of his body. As a dying wish he asks Ka
 kashi to take his newly awakened Sharingan and “be his eyes and see the future for him”. As his comrades continue the mission Obito wishes he could’ve spent more time with every body. When Obito wakes up he sees and old Uchiha Madara who he believes, at first to be a ‘shinigami’. Obito looks to see that Madara has patched him up but his ‘new’ body is very iak. Madara then talks to Obito about this world about the darkness of this world and how he plans to make a new one. Obito disregards what Madara says and is in term more focused on strengthening himself. Obito after a while then receives intel that Kakashi and Rin are being pursued by shinobi from kirigakure, as Obito arrives on the seen he sees Kakashi penetrating Rin with a lightning blade. In the subsequent rage, Obito’s sharingan evoloved into a Mangekyo sharingan and he slaughtered each and every shinobi on the battlefield except Kakashi who had lost consciousness after killing Rin. Obito then holds onto Rin’s life less body and realizes the truth in Madara’s words and proclaims this world is hell. He then goes back to madara who instructs him on how to create an ideal world by casting a genjutsu on the moon (I’m not gonna go into details here) and as Madara dies he tells him to take is identity until the time he is revived. He then forms the Akatsuki, an organisation to help in realising his goal. Invades Konoha and causes the nine tails to go berserk on it and has a clash with his former sensei, Minato, but is defeated. After many. many years Obito declares war on the Five Great Nations after their refusal to hand over the remaining of the living jinchirukis. In the end his identity is uncovered by Naruto. Kakashi is dumbfounded and when asking him why he had become like this Obito replied with a simple “Because you let Rin die”. He clashes with the Allied forces and then with Kakashi before becoming the Ten tails jinchuriki. In the end Obito has a change of heart. He was going to die to revive everyone he killed using ‘Rinne Tensei no Jutsu’ but black zetsu took over him and only Madara was revived. After being presumed dead he helped team 7 with their battle against Kaguya and died a proud Konoha shinobi, regretting he hadn’t folloid the path
  of evil and instead folloid his dream of becoming hokage

<p> the normal truth to fine out ither who will win this battle is that who will transform. normally killer bee will get to eight-tails before jaraiya and then he could have some advantages over but that doesnt mean he would win the battle but for jaraiya it might take him time to use his sage mode
but if he does and unlockes sage mode, <b>O.M.G</b> killer bee is done for or in other words if he activates his sage mode this fight ends in one or two minutes. <b style="color: green"> so the obivouse winner is jaraiya</b>.. dont forget to give comments and reviews is still wondering or doubting, fell free to come to ikomi tina henry studio.</p>
